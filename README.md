# Hi there, Iâ€™m Lukas Van der Spiegel ðŸ‘‹

**Professional & Creative Software Developer**

Hi! Iâ€™m Sidge, a passionate software developer and student with a solid focus on the .NET, React.js, SQL, and MongoDB stack. Iâ€™m also comfortable working with Python, Java, Dart, and C++ ... I might not be a pro in all of them, but I love picking up new languages and technologies. My toolbox includes Docker, Git, and Linux, which I use daily to build, ship, and maintain scalable solutions.

Most of my proudest projects were developed for companies and are not publicly accessible, but theyâ€™ve given me strong experience in building robust, real-world applications.

Outside of coding, youâ€™ll find me on the karting track or sim-racing onlineâ€”Iâ€™m an avid F1 and Le Mans fan, always chasing the next adrenaline rush!
